I was able to provide valuable insights to improve their business. Here are some of the key findings:

## Financial Insights: 

**1.** I generated an [Actual vs Target](https://github.com/Talkaro/Excel-Analytics/blob/main/Actual%20vs%20Target.pdf) Revenue Report for different countries, and unfortunately, no country was able to achieve their targets in 2021.  
**2.** By analyzing the [Trading Report](https://github.com/Talkaro/Excel-Analytics/blob/main/Trading%20Report.pdf), I noticed a significant jump in metrics like Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold, and Gross Margin from 2020 to 2021, indicating substantial growth. However, the Gross Margin remained similar to the previous year, suggesting that the targets set might have been too ambitious.  
**3.** I also examined the [Gross Margin%](https://github.com/Talkaro/Excel-Analytics/blob/main/GM%25%20by%20Quarters.pdf) for different sub-zones for different quarters over the years and found a saturation in most regions since 2019, except for the ANZ region, which experienced a rise in 2020.  
**4.** Using the [Trading Report for 2021](https://github.com/Talkaro/Excel-Analytics/blob/main/P%26L%20Market.pdf), I discovered that India had the highest Net Sales and Gross Margin, while New Zealand, Japan, and the Netherlands had better Gross Margin percentages.  
**5.** By analyzing the [Trading Report for all months](https://github.com/Talkaro/Excel-Analytics/blob/main/P%26L%20Month.pdf), I observed a significant hike in Gross Margin% in September, which could be attributed to the beginning of the fiscal year.  
## Sales Insights: 

**1.** I generated a [report on Net Sales](https://github.com/Talkaro/Excel-Analytics/blob/main/Sales%20Report.pdf) for different customers across the years and calculated the percentage increase in sales from 2020 to 2021.  
**2.** The [Performance vs Target Sales](https://github.com/Talkaro/Excel-Analytics/blob/main/Sales%20Report.pdf) Report for all countries showed that none of them were able to meet their targets.  
**3.** The Top [10 Products report](https://github.com/Talkaro/Excel-Analytics/blob/main/Sales%20Report%202.pdf) revealed that AQ Mx NO recorded an impressive 5623.52% increase in sales from 2020 to 2021.  
**4.** I also generated a [Division-level report](https://github.com/Talkaro/Excel-Analytics/blob/main/Sales%20Report%202.pdf) and a report on the [top 5 and bottom 5 products](https://github.com/Talkaro/Excel-Analytics/blob/main/Sales%20Report%202.pdf) based on the quantity sold.  
**5.** Furthermore, I compiled a list of [new products manufactured in 2021](https://github.com/Talkaro/Excel-Analytics/blob/main/Sales%20Report%202.pdf) and identified the top 5 countries according to net sales.
